The checkout form includes validation to ensure that all necessary fields are completed with valid data, providing a smooth and error-free experience. Upon submitting the order, an HTTP request is sent to the backend, and the order details are securely processed. After successfully placing an order, users receive a confirmation message, reassuring them that their meal is on its way.
