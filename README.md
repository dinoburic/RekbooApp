## About
Rekboo is a user-friendly platform built to simplify your meal ordering experience. Developed with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, this app allows users to easily browse through available meals, add their desired items to the cart, and proceed to a seamless checkout process.

## Meals
Whether youâ€™re craving Italian, Bosnian, Indian, or any other type of cuisine, Rekboo offers a diverse menu to satisfy your tastes. The app is crafted to ensure a quick and reliable ordering process, making it easy for you to explore different culinary options and place your order with just a few clicks.

## Cart
With the flexible cart functionality, users can easily add meals to their cart and adjust the quantity of each item according to their preferences.

## Checkout
When ready to place an order, users are guided through a straightforward checkout process, where they are required to input their personal information, such as name, address, and contact info.

The checkout form includes validation to ensure that all necessary fields are completed with valid data, providing a smooth and error-free experience. Upon submitting the order, an HTTP request is sent to the backend, and the order details are securely processed. After successfully placing an order, users receive a confirmation message, reassuring them that their meal is on its way.
